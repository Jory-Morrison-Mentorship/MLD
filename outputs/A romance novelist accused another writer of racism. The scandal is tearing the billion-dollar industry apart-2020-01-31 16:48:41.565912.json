        "body": "(CNN) To say the romance publishing industry is in upheaval right now would be an almost comical understatement. It's more scandalized than a dowager countess finding her headstrong niece alone on the lap of a rakish duke. It's more divided than a reluctant billionaire who has to choose between the family business and his love for a beautiful corporate rival.      Yeah, it's exactly like that.      In a matter of weeks, the heads of the industry's leading board, the Romance Writers of America (RWA), have stepped down amid accusations of discrimination and exclusion. The RITAs -- essentially the Oscars of romance writing -- have been canceled . Major publishers have withdrawn from the annual Romance Writers Convention. Dozens of prominent writers have pledged not to renew their RWA membership. And, as the ground continues to shift under their feet, authors and loyal readers are finding themselves adrift in a sea of uncertainty and mistrust.      The scandal started when prominent author Courtney Milan was punished by the RWA after she called out another author's alleged use of racist stereotypes and questioned a publisher about a staff member who had allegedly exercised offensive and problematic views.      Since then, the situation has devolved into a gigantic, multi-pronged controversy about diversity and discrimination in the romance industry, and the commotion is far from over.      At the center of this conflagration is Courtney Milan, an author of Chinese descent who writes romances whose characters span diverse races, sexuality orientations and ages. She, like many romance authors, has an active and influential presence on social media.      'I've said this before and I'll say it again: Don't write books about how much a culture not your own sucks,' Milan said (the author, Davis, is white). 'Just don't. You're not going to get it right and you're going to sound like a f****** racist.'      After these discussions, both Davis and Grimshaw filed complaints against Milan through the RWA. Tisdale's came first, in August, and then-RWA President HelenKay Dimon asked Milan to resign as chairperson of the RWA's Ethics Committee. Davis' complaint came in September, and claimed Milan violated the RWA's social media policy and hurt Lynn's reputation and earning potential.      A few months later, in December, the RWA Board voted to censure Milan, suspending her membership for a year and banning her from holding leadership on any RWA committees.      The reaction was swift and scathing. Milan and Cole are part of a community of authors who champion diversity and inclusion in the genre, and like-minded fans and colleagues saw the RWA's actions as completely backwards. The common question was this: Why did the RWA Board choose to censure someone for calling out racism, instead of investigating said claims of racism?      'I was censured by my writer's organization for making comments on social media about the systemic racism of a publisher and that publisher's editors, after having received a service award from that writer's organization for spending four years working to address systemic racism within the industry,' Milan said in a statement provided to CNN.      On January 6th, the RWA cancelled its annual RITA awards, which honors the best in romance writing.      The cancellation of the RITAs officially rocketed the controversy from esoteric industry squabble to national news, and all at once, a steady stream of announcements from major publishers roundly rebuked the actions of the RWA.      'As a leading global publisher of romance fiction that is committed to diversity and inclusion, we at Harlequin believe it is important that all authors feel included, respected and heard,' reads a statement from Harlequin and HarperCollins Canada. 'Recently reported actions by RWA leadership have therefore led us to decide not to sponsor or attend the RWA2020 national conference.'      in the midst of all this comment and counter-comment, a string of RWA leaders announced their resignations in response to the scandal, including several board members, committee members and advisors. As the dominoes fell, pressure mounted for RWA President Damon Suede to resign for, among other things, his role in Milan's censure and the alleged secrecy and obfuscation with which the decision was made.      'We know we have a lot more work to do to restore the trust we have lost -- and we are going to do whatever it takes to get there so that we can focus on the mission of this organization: to promote the professional and common business interests of romance writers,' a statement from the RWA reads.      What it all means      While the drama has been more complex than the family tree of a troubled Regency hero, the heart of the matter is rather basic: More and more, influencers in the romance world are making efforts to champion the work of traditionally marginalized writers. In fact, it may surprise the romance newcomer to learn just how progressive the genre can be. Bestselling works by writers like Milan and the aforementioned Cole feature diverse heroes and heroines and touch on difficult topics like immigration and sexual identity. Historical romance writers have brought more diversity to their works and layer strong themes of empowerment and independence between the traditional chemises and stays.      The question at hand is whether this inclusion and advocacy is reflected among the genre's leaders and gatekeepers today.      How will it end?      'This entire matter has been a massive breach of fiduciary duty, and I am heartbroken that an organization that I served for four years has decided to set itself on fire in a win for absolutely nobody,' Milan said in a statement.      The RWA also needs to fill several vacant seats and choose a new leader, a Herculean task made even more difficult by the erosion of trust and conflicts of interest the scandal has created. The RWA declined to comment when contacted, but directed CNN to the statement mentioning Suede's resignation. In the statement, the RWA says the association has hired an external firm to conduct an audit of the events leading to the controversy and has brought on a diversity, equity and inclusion consultant to 'assist RWA with diversifying Board and staff recruitment' as well as future programming and events.      Works of romantic fiction can take readers across the globe, through time and into different dimensions, but the one thing that unites them is the promise that somehow, some way, everything will work out.      As this scandal continues to unfold, the creators at the heart of the romance industry will have to weave their trickiest happy ending yet.",
