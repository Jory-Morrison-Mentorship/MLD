It was one of the worst day in months for stocks, and thewas down 549 points at its lowest, closing 454 points, or 1.6% lower.

Thefinished down 1.9%, its biggest one-day loss since August.      European exchanges are also lower, while Asian markets are closed for the Lunar New Year holiday.      Stocks sold off last week amid fears of a global pandemic. The outbreak, which so far has infected thousands people and killed 80, concerns investors about the Chinese economy.      As the second-largest economy in the world, any drop off in China's growth could hurt the global economy, which has already slowed over the past year.      Although the outbreak could be short-lived, it could pose a notable threat to China's economic growth, depending on its duration and severity, noted Oxford Economics economists Tommy Wu and Priyanka Kishore in a note to clients.      'We think that consumption and travel will be the most affected, and to a lesser degree investment and industrial production. We also expect the Chinese government to roll out measures to stabilize growth, if needed,' Wu and Kishore said.      Traditional safe-haven assets rallied higher on Monday. The price for gold settled 0.4% higher at $1,576.80 per ounce, and the 10-year US Treasury bond yield slipped to 1.6%. Bond yields and prices move opposite to each other.",
