        "body": "(CNN) Here's a look at abortion in the United States.      * The totals may fluctuate depending on how many states provide numbers in a given year.      The abortion ratio increased from 196 per 1,000 live births in 1973 to 358 per 1,000 in 1979 and remained nearly stable through 1981.      The ratio peaked at 364 per 1,000 in 1984 and has steadily declined since then.      2016 is the most recent year for which the CDC has released statistics. The reporting areas for 2016 data are from 48 of the requested 52 areas.      The abortion rate decreased 2% from 2015 to 2016. There were 11.6 abortions per 1,000 women ages 15-44.      According to the CDC, 65.5% were performed at the eighth week or earlier and more than 91% were performed at or before 13 weeks. About 7.7% were performed between 14 and 20 weeks and the remaining 1.2% were performed at or above 21 weeks.      In 2016, 27.9% of all abortions were performed as early medical (nonsurgical) abortions and 59.9% were surgical abortions at 13 weeks or more. Around 8.8% were surgically performed after 13 weeks and 3.4% were performed by medical abortion earlier than eight weeks. The remaining 0.1% were performed via uncommon methods.",
