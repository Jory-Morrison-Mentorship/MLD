It governs common economic, social and security policies of its member states.      According to the EU website, the objectives of the European Union are to establish European citizenship, ensure freedom, justice and security, promote economic and social progress, and assert Europe's role in the world.      Membership is open to any country with a democratic government, a good human rights record, and sound economic policies.      The member states delegate sovereignty to the EU institutions to represent the interests of the European Union as a whole.      Decisions and procedures stem from treaties ratified by the member states.      The capital of the European Union is Brussels, Belgium.      The European Union is run by five main bodies: European Parliament, Council of the Union, European Commission, Court of Justice, and the Court of Auditors.      The United States is the European Union's main trading partner.      The Treaty of Lisbon amends the Treaty on European Union to explicitly recognize for the first time the member states' right to withdraw from the union. (Article 50, amended TEU)      - Any member state may decide to withdraw from the Union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements.      - A member state which decides to withdraw shall notify the European Council of its intention. In the light of the guidelines provided by the European Council, the Union shall negotiate and conclude an agreement with that State, setting out the arrangements for its withdrawal, taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the Union.            1957 - The European Economic Community (EEC) is created.
