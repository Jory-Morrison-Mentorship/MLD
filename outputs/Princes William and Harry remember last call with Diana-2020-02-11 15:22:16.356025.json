The two brothers were at Balmoral Castle in Scotland when Diana called from Paris.      'I can't necessarily remember what I said, but all I do remember is regretting for the rest of my life how short the phone call was,' Harry told ITV.      'If I'd known that that was the last time I was going to speak to my mother, the things I would have said to her,' he said. 'Looking back at it now -- it's incredibly hard. I have to deal with that for the rest of my life: not knowing that it was the last time I'd speak to my mum, how differently that conversation would have panned out if I'd had even the slightest inkling that her life was going to be taken that night.'      In the documentary, Prince William said he and his brother had been 'running around, minding our own business, playing with our cousins and having a very good time' and were in a rush to say 'goodbye, see you later, can I go off?' 'If I'd known what was going to happen I wouldn't have been quite so blas\u00e9 about it,' the Duke of Cambridge said. 'That phone call sticks in my mind quite heavily.' 'Kid through and through' Diana, Princess of Wales, holding Prince William while pregnant with Prince Harry. The ITV documentary, 'Diana, Our Mother: Her Life and Legacy,' celebrates the life and work of Diana, Princess of Wales, in the 20th year since her death, according to a press release by the network. The Duke of Cambridge said the time felt right to talk about their mother. 'There's not many days that go by that I don't think of her. Her 20th anniversary year feels like a good time to ... remember, you know, all the good things about her and hopefully provide maybe a different side to her that others haven't seen before,' he said. Princess Diana remains a beloved figure more than 20 years after her untimely death. See more photos of the British icon and the legacy she left behind.
