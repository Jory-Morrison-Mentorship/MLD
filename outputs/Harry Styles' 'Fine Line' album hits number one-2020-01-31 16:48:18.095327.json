The former 'One Direction' star's sophomore album, 'Fine Line,' hit number one on the Billboard 200 chart this week. According to Billboard , 'it marks the biggest week for a pop album by a male artist in over four years.'      Styles also landed number one on the Rolling Stone Top 200 Albums Chart . It's the second highest debut in the chart's history, beating Post Malone's 'Hollywood's Bleeding.'
