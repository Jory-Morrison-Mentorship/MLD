Pelosi is a 'fierce servant of our nation (and) 'Drag Race's' mission is to teach the children and honor those who fight on our behalf,' Barbato said in an email to CNN. The producers of 'Drag Race' reached out to Pelosi's team, who Barbato said 'were happy to participate.' Barbato wouldn't give any spoilers on Pelosi's appearance. However, he said Pelosi 'was absolutely delightful and the entire cast and crew were moved by her visit.' Season three of the drag-queen competition show kicks off January 25.",
