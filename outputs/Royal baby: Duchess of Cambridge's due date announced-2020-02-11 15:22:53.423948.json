Kate's pregnancy was announced by the palace last month.      At the time, she was said to be suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum , severe levels of nausea and vomiting, a more serious health risk than the morning sickness many women suffer during early pregnancy.      The duchess was affected by the same condition during her two previous pregnancies.",
