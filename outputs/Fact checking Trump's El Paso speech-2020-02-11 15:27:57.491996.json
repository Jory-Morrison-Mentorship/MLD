        "body": "(CNN) President Donald Trump repeated a few hits from his State of the Union address to an El Paso, Texas, audience on Monday night -- in a much more lively and rambunctious setting. He also poked fun at the Green New Deal and prattled off his old line that China is paying 'billions' into the US Treasury.      Let's take a facts-first look at some claims in the President's speech.                  'I really don't like their policy of taking away your car, of taking away your airplane flights, of 'Let's hop a train to California,' of you're not allowed to own cows anymore. Lot of problems.'      While Trump is extrapolating extreme outcomes like eliminating people's cars, he's not entirely off base in his characterization, given some of its stated objectives.      The resolution looks to overhaul transportation in the US by removing 'pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector as much as is technologically feasible.' When it comes to cows and farming the language is similar, looking to 'remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector as much as is technologically feasible.'      It's unclear what would constitute 'technologically feasible' in these circumstances. The bigger consideration would likely be how economically feasible any of these goals would be. More of a mission statement than a fully baked piece of legislation, the Green New Deal is long on aspiration and short on specifics. For example, while it lays out its goals and objectives, it doesn't get into many details on how it would achieve them.      Cows and airplanes are mentioned in the FAQ in a section on why the bill chose '100% clean and renewable' as opposed to '100% renewable.' Part of the answer? 'We aren't sure that we'll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast.'      When it comes to cars, the FAQ set a 'goal to replace every combustion-engine vehicle.'      That FAQ, however, has been removed from Ocasio-Cortez's website.      One of the clearest points to emerge from Trump's El Paso speech is that as he pivots to the 2020 election he seems inclined to paint the Democrats as socialists. To that end, the President will likely continue to bring up the Green New Deal and try to use it to his political advantage.      'I heard the same thing from the fake news, they said, 'Oh, crime actually stayed the same.' Didn't stay the same. Went way down.'      During his speech, Trump reiterated his criticism of Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam's comments in a radio interview on third trimester abortion. The President also attacked 'extreme late-term abortion' and continued his call for legislation prohibiting those cases.      Trump made similar comments during his State of the Union address, here's the context and facts we found then:      Later, a spokesperson for Northam said his 'comments were limited to the actions physicians would take in the event that a woman in those circumstances (i.e. nonviable pregnancy and severe fetal abnormalities) went into labor.'      This clarification, however, does not address the statement made by Northam that 'the infant would be delivered.'      New York's new law expands access to abortions into the third trimester by loosening restrictions on when the procedure is permitted. Previously, an abortion could be performed after 24 weeks only if the physician deemed it necessary to preserve the woman's life. Under the new law, the requirement has been expanded to include the woman's general health.      'Those tariffs are costing (China) a lot of money and they're going into our Treasury. Remember that. We're filling up with billions of dollars.'      When Trump talks about tariffs, he often talks about the amount of money that is now pouring into the US Treasury. He tends to give the impression that money is being paid by foreign companies. But that's not really what's happening. Instead, most of those tariffs are being paid by US companies that import those foreign goods. The real question is who bears the cost. Often, US companies will pass it on to the consumer by raising prices, while other times a company will reduce compensation or employment internally to offset these higher costs. In some instances, the Chinese supplier might take on the burden of the tariff by reducing its prices in order to maintain its price advantage in the US.      Trump is trying to realign trade so that US products become more competitive with their cheaper Chinese alternatives. That will likely require a long-term adjustment of the US industrial base. In the short term, US consumers and companies will most likely end up bearing the cost of the tariffs. The Tax Foundation said last year that it expects the tariffs to lower the gross domestic product and wages, and cost American jobs, hitting lower- and middle-income households the hardest.      'The United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas on earth.'      It's true, but could use some context.      The US became the world's largest crude oil producer in August, when it surpassed Russia for the first time since 1999 in terms of total daily crude production, according to the US Energy Information Administration. Earlier in the year, the US surpassed Saudi Arabia's crude oil production for the first time since 1973. It has been the largest producer of natural gas since 2011.      The rise in US oil and gas production is due in large part to advances in fracking technology that allowed drillers to access reserves socked away in shale formations buried deep underground. Production dipped in 2015 and 2016 as a result of overproduction and a collapse in oil prices, but recovered quickly once supply stabilized and prices increased, just as Trump was coming into office.      The Trump administration often touts its moves to relax Obama-era rules on oil and gas production, such as one restricting the flaring of methane from fracking sites. He has also opened public lands to more drilling. It's unclear though, given the decade of increased energy production in the US, how much of an impact any of those moves have had.",
