        "body": "Washington (CNN) Thousands of pages of transcripts are piling up, and top minds from both political parties are preparing their best strategy as the impeachment investigation into President Donald Trump moves into a new phase Wednesday with the first public hearings .      A clearer picture of Trump's dealings with Ukraine has finally emerged after weeks of testimony from key witnesses. At the heart of the inquiry is whether Trump used the powers of his office to pressure Ukraine to help his reelection by announcing investigations into his political opponents.      Trump could become the third president in American history to be impeached. The United States Constitution says the sitting President 'shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.' Democrats and Republicans will fight in the coming weeks over whether Trump crossed that threshold.      CNN spoke to legal experts and analysts from both sides of the political spectrum to break down all the evidence, and to tally up the strongest points for and against impeaching Trump.      After an exchange of pleasantries, Trump said the US had been 'very good to Ukraine' but the relationship was not 'reciprocal.' Zelensky thanked Trump for providing Ukraine with military assistance and said he was almost ready to purchase additional anti-tank missiles from the US.      Trump responded, 'I would like you to do us a favor though,' and asked Zelensky to investigate a conspiracy theory that would help him undermine the Russia investigation. Later in the call, Trump asked Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading 2020 rival.      'The Ukraine situation encapsulates almost exactly what impeachment was created to address,' said CNN legal analyst Michael Gerhardt, who was called as a nonpartisan expert witness on impeachment during the Clinton hearings. 'When the Framers talked about impeachable offenses, they mentioned the President engaging in a corrupt relationship with a foreign power.'      There was a quid pro quo for a White House invite      'I think it's very likely that the Democrats will be able to show that there were conditions to presidential actions on Ukraine,' said CNN legal analyst Ross Garber, a leading expert on impeachment. 'Then the question becomes, were those conditions legitimate or illegitimate?'      One element of the allegedly improper arrangement included withholding a White House invitation from Zelensky. The clearest evidence of this comes from a text message sent by Kurt Volker, who was Trump's handpicked envoy for Ukraine, to top Zelensky aide Andrey Yermak.      There was a quid pro quo for US military aid      George Kent, a top State Department official overseeing Ukraine policy, testified that US military support for Ukraine was 'critically important' but 'partisan interest' got in the way of US policy.      'That's the most compelling argument why aid to Ukraine was in our national security interests,' said CNN contributor Joe Lockhart, who was President Bill Clinton's press secretary during his impeachment. 'Russia is at war with Ukraine, our ally. But President Trump put his own political interests ahead of our national security interests. That's why it rises to an impeachable offense.'      'They need to be careful to be simple,' said CNN contributor Paul Begala, a senior Clinton adviser during his impeachment. 'Donald Trump knows that simple and clear slogans, repeated relentlessly, can have an effect. The Democrats should just call this what it is. It's bribery.'      Trump deployed his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani to lead the effort to secure investigations from Ukraine. As Giuliani worked to make that happen, he circumvented State Department channels and undermined US policy toward Ukraine, multiple witnesses told lawmakers.      'The direction from Trump was clear -- work with Giuliani because he represents me in this matter,' CNN legal analyst Michael Zeldin said. 'Giuliani has confirmed that in his tweets, that he was working on behalf of the President. Giuliani was working under Trump's authorization.'      As part of his shadow diplomacy, Giuliani also pressed for the removal of Marie Yovanovitch, a career foreign service officer who served as US ambassador to Ukraine from 2016 until May of this year.      She testified that after she was instructed to leave Ukraine, she was informed by Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan that she had 'done nothing wrong' and that the State Department 'had been under pressure from the President to remove me' since summer 2018.      'One of the elements of an impeachable offense is that you have to show bad faith,' said Gerhardt, the impeachment expert. 'Shoving aside US diplomats and conducing your own shadow foreign policy is the same as shoving aside the US Constitution. If the State Department wasn't ready to help Trump do what he wanted, that says a lot. It underscores the bad faith.'      At least 10 senior Trump administration officials have ignored subpoenas, including Mulvaney, Perry and Pompeo. The State Department and the Office of Management and Budget have defied subpoenas for documents that could shed new light on Trump's dealings with Ukraine.      'I believe the House of Representatives is acting under its impeachment authority, and has the legal right to this testimony,' Zeldin said. 'For White House witnesses to refuse to honor these subpoenas, it appears obstructionist to me. There is no arguable basis to deny Congress.'      If Democrats want to broaden their obstruction case against Trump, they have options.      The process of the inquiry was fatally flawed      Primary among their concerns is the fact that Trump's lawyers don't have a guaranteed role in the private depositions and public hearings, which means his legal team can't cross-examine witnesses. Republicans are also upset that they don't have unilateral power to issue subpoenas.      'They are going to say that the process was not designed to get to the truth,' Garber said, noting that Clinton's lawyers were given the right to participate in his impeachment proceedings.      If the House votes to impeach, the few Senate Republicans who might have reservations about Trump's actions with Ukraine could still vote for his acquittal and place the blame on Democrats for tainting the investigation.      'Republicans will remind us of the incredibly high standard for impeachment, and that in the entire history of our country, no president has been found guilty of meeting that standard,' Garber said. 'The standard is so incredibly high, and the costs to the country are so serious.'      The Constitution says the President is the commander in chief of the armed forces, and it also gives the President the power to make treaties and appoint ambassadors, with approval from the Senate. Besides that, the Constitution doesn't delineate many other foreign policy powers.      'You're taking a President and you're going after him for an abuse of authority in an area where it's almost impossible to abuse authority, because he has almost absolute authority in that area,' said former Sen. Rick Santorum, a CNN contributor who was one of the Republicans who negotiated the rules for Clinton's impeachment trial in the Senate. 'It's just a big reach for them.'      The centerpiece of the inquiry hangs on Trump's diplomatic dealings -- not a Watergate-type scandal where people clearly broke the law or lies under oath like Clinton. Trump's lawyers might argue at his Senate trial that even though Democrats don't like what Trump did with Ukraine, he is still the President, and he can handle foreign diplomacy however he wants.      To prove that Trump is guilty, Democrats will need to show that he had corrupt intentions when he directed his diplomats to work with Giuliani and when he asked for the 'favor' from Zelensky.      Nobody has testified that Trump explicitly told them he was pushing the quid pro quo because he wanted to weaken Biden's campaign or boost his own chances of getting reelected. Trump's defenders have said witnesses who confirmed the quid pro quo were giving their own 'opinions' or making 'presumptions.' Two of those witnesses, Taylor and Vindman, never spoke to Trump.      'I don't know what was in the President's mind,' Taylor said during his closed-door deposition.      'Trump is very bright, but he doesn't read a lot, and buys into a lot of conspiracy theories,' McCollum said. 'Some of those theories could be correct, and he wants to find out what really happened in 2016. I'm not sure there's anything wrong with that. Is that in the national interest, or is it purely political? That's the rub. It'll be difficult for the Democrats to separate those two.'      Ukraine got the military assistance after all      Republicans will have political cover to vote against Trump's impeachment, or to acquit him in the Senate, because they can say Ukraine ultimately got the money, and Trump got nothing.      'The people who were supposedly doing the quid pro quo didn't find out until months after,' Santorum said. 'So, how do you have a quid pro quo when no one knows that it's happening?'      To be clear, Democrats can impeach Trump for simply attempting the quid pro quo, if they have the votes. But Republicans are certain to make the counterpoint that despite all the bluster and the noise, this affair created a brief two-month delay that didn't damage US national security.",
